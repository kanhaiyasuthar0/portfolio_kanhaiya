          When I started my coding journey it was amidst a lot of skepticism, as
          I was moving from Civil Engineering to IT. I feel that it is never too
          late to start something you actually like. During my final year, I
          started learning coding from YouTube and documentations. After 6
          months of coding, I was confident that I wanted to pursue coding as my
          career. To enhance my knowledge and get proper guidance, I joined
          Masai School. <br /> Currently, I am pursuing a Full Stack Web Development
          course and with the help of Masai School my journey has come a long
          way. I am capable of writing production-ready code using React, Redux,
          and CSS on the frontend, NodeJS and Express on the backend to build
          single page applications. Passionate about coding and strongly
          interested in working in a product based company.

					Hello! My name is  Kanhaiya  and I enjoy creating things that are live on the internet. My interest in web development started
					back last year when I was trying to edit things on the web â€”
					taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!. <br />
					<br /> Fast Forwarding to today, I built a number of web
					applications and 3 major projects. Learned a great deal
					about teamwork, leadership, and communication. After months
					of rigorous training, here I am
